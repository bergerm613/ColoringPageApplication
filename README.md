# Coloring Page Creator

## This java application allows the user to upload an image from their computer and then convert it into a coloring page. 

### The Coloring Page Creator does this by: 

1. Converting the image to grayscale. 
2. Inverting the image. 
3. Blurring the image. 
4. Color and Dodge - divide the original image by the inverted/blurred top layer to receive only the dark edges.
